Formulate a linear programming problem using the provided data as shown below:

Objective of the company includes maximization of total sales. Profit derived from per unit sales of each blend is $2.05 and $1.85, respectively. **Write the objective in mathematical format as shown below:**

Now, write down the constraints of the linear programming problem as shown below:

**Constraint 1:**Availability of coffee from Country C is 10 pounds per day.

**Constraint 2:**Availability of coffee from Country K is 10 pounds per day.

**Constraint 3:**Availability of coffee from Country I is 10 pounds per day.

**Constraint 4:**The shop sells 1.5 times more coffee blend P as compared to coffee blend C.

**Constraint 5:**The café has a total brewing capacity of 30 gallons. 1 cup of coffee contains 16 oz. of coffee.

Use following formula to convert gallons to oz.:

Therefore, the number of cups of coffee the café can brew is calculated as shown below:

Therefore, the constraint is as follows:

**Constraint 6:**Non-negativity constraint for the total number of chairs and tables.

Hence, the linear programming problem for the given data is as follows:
